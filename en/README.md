## Project mission

The goal of Excelize is to create and maintain a Python language version of the Excel Document API to handle xlsx files that conform to the Office Open XML (OOXML) standard. With Excelize you can use Python to read and write MS Excel files.

## Why use Excelize

In some cases, we need to manipulate Excel documents through programs, such as: open to read existing Excel document content, create new Excel documents, generate new Excel documents based on existing documents (templates), insert images into Excel documents, charts Elements such as tables and sometimes need to implement these operations across platforms. Excelize can easily meet these needs.
